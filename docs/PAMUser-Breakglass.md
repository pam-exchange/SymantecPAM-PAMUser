# PAM User for Breakglass

The connector for `PAM User` can be used to manage password for a local PAM user. One scenario is to let PAM mange the login password for a PAM user and keep it in a secure place. This is a breakglass type scenario. The setup in the example here is to let PAM manage the login password for a local PAM user.

More details about breakglass scenarios and how it can be used is available in the repo [Breakglass](https://github.com/pam-exchange/Breakglass).

In PAM the password update for PAM users is using the API. Main reason is that with the API there is an option to change the password without the user being required to change the password at next login. When using the CLI such an option is not available and a user would be required to change the password at next login.

When using the API it is required to define an ApiKey and associate it with the PAM user.

> [!NOTE]
> In the example here a new PAM user is created for a breakglass purpose. A similar configuration aned setup can be used for the local built-in administrator `super`. 


# PAM setup

## Global Settings

An important update is the password length for local PAM users. Default length is 16 characters, which probably is insufficient. Edit the PAM system Global Settings and change the password length to 72 characters (maximum length).

## PAM User (Login)

The local PAM user being managed by PAM in the example here is a Global Administrator. It is possible to define other roles and permissions for the managed user. If so, the ApiKey associated with the PAM user must have permissions to list and search target accounts and target servers. It is also possible to limit the scope of accounts for the ApiKey by using a target group. This is not used in the example shown here.

The role for the PAM user in the example is a `Global Administrator`. 

![PAM User - Roles](/docs/images/BG-User-2.png)

A `Global Administrator` must also have a Credential Managemnt Group associated.

Finally, for the user define an ApiKey. Initially when it is created the ID is zero (0). When the user is saved the ApiKey is created as a target account and the ID will change to a different value

## ApiKey

In the setup used when creating a new local PAM users a standard ApiKey is also created for this PAM user.  
This ApiKey is used when the `PAM User` connector is requesting a password update for a local PAM user.

### ApiKey - Password Composition Policy

The PCP used for the of ApiKey used here is dynamic and will update when the age reaches 1 day. A different schedule can be used.

![PCP - ApiKey Dynamic](/docs/images/PCP-ApiKey-dynamic.png)

### ApiKey - TargetApplication

It is important to differentiate a standard ApiKey with the dynamic ApiKey used here. A new target application `ApiKey-dynamic` is created using the PCP with higher length for passwords and with an age limit enforcement.

![TargetApplication - ApiKey Dynamic](/docs/images/BG-TargetApplication-ApiKey.png)

### ApiKey - TargetAccount

Finally, for the ApiKey the internal ID is added to the name used when the local PAM user is created. Identify the correct target account (ApiKey) and change the target application to `ApiKey-dynamic`.

![TargetAccount - ApiKey](/docs/images/BG-TargetAccount-ApiKey.png)

When updating the target account for the ApiKey verify that it is synchronizing with PAM (tab `Passwords`) and create a new random password for the ApiKey.

## PAM User (Managed)

The PAM user to be managed by PAM is a local PAM user. Create a target application and account using the same username as for the local PAM user. 

## PAM User - Password Composition Policy

The length of passwords in this PCP must not be greater then the password length for PAM users defined in the Global Settings. Create a PCP used for new passwords generated by the `PAM User` connector. If the target account is used for breakglass purposes, it is important that there is no age enforcemwent defined in the PCP.

![PCP - PAM User Static](/docs/images/PCP-PAMUser-Passwords-static.png)

### PAM User - TargetApplication

The PAM User is using a target account existing on a target server, which is the PAM system itself. If using a PAM cluster the target server used here is a member of the primary site.

Cerate the target application using the PCP created for PAM Users.

![TargetApplication - PAM User](/docs/images/BG-TargetApplication-User-1.png)

Use defaults for the tab `PAM User`. The communication path from TCF where the connector is running to PAM should be very good. 

![TargetApplication - PAM User](/docs/images/BG-TargetApplication-User-2.png)


In the tab `PAM User (remote)` verify that the checkbox `PAM is remote` is unchecked.

![TargetApplication - PAM User](/docs/images/BG-TargetApplication-User-3.png)


### PAM User - TargetAccount

Finally, create a target account using the account name matching name of the local PAM user. Create a new random value for the password. 

![TargetAccount - PAM User](/docs/images/BG-TargetAccount-User-1.png)

In the tab `Password` change the synchronize setting to update both PAM and end-point.

In the tab `PAM User` Set the account type to `PAM User` and use the ApiKey defined when the PAM user was created as the master account.

![TargetAccount - PAM User](/docs/images/BG-TargetAccount-User-2.png)

That's about it. Saving the target account will update the password for the local PAM user to a new random value.


# Improvements and things to consider

- In the example here there is just one master account. It is possible to setup two ApiKey accounts for the local PAM user and let PAM manage both of them. In such a setup the two ApiKey accounts are master for each other. 

- Define target groups to limit scope of what an ApiKey can access.

- Define permissions for ApiKey to minimum required to update passwords on local PAM users.


# Error handling

If the API call to update the PAM user is failing, the API return code is visible in the `$CATALINA_HOME/logs/cataline.log` on the TCF server.
